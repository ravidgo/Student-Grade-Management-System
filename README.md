# Student-Grade-Management-System


## Description
The Student Grade Management System project provides a command-line interface for managing student details and their grades using a shared library for a linked list abstract data type (ADT). This system allows users to perform various operations, such as adding students, assigning grades, calculating averages, and printing information, making it an effective tool for educational institutions or academic purposes. The project showcases my skills in implementing data structures and algorithms to solve practical problems efficiently.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** C
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** C standard library for data handling
- **Tools:** Git for version control, Make for building the project

## Features
- **Student Management:** Add, modify, and delete student records seamlessly.
- **Grade Assignment:** Assign grades to students and manage their academic performance.
- **Average Calculation:** Calculate and display average grades for individual students.
- **Data Persistence:** Utilizes a linked list ADT for efficient storage and retrieval of student records.
- **Command-Line Interface:** User-friendly interface for interacting with the system.
